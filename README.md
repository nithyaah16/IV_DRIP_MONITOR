# IV_DRIP_MONITOR
If nurses do not stop or replace the infusion at the appropriate moment when the IV bottle is empty and the infusion procedure is complete, it might result in an air embolism in the IV tube, which can be fatal or harm the patientâ€™s health. And hence, to tackle a real-world issue here: real-time patient monitoring we propose a IV drip monitoring device which alerts the caregiver in case of low or empty content in the IV container. The essential part of our system is to use 8051 microcontroller to detect the fluid/content level in the IV bag and send a signal through buzzer/alarm alerting the caregiver to check and refill the IV bag. This system which integrates a lot of features such as displaying the level of fluid content in the IV bag in percentage in a LCD display and producing a buzzing sound to alert the caregiver.
